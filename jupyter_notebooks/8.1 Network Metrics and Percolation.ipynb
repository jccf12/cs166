    "We can see how how the LLC size increases in a hyperbolic kind of way, very rapidly at first and then stabilizes and demonstrates an asympotitic behavior. It seems like around \"k=1.5\" the LLC is at least half the size of the full graph in terms of the number of nodes. At around 3 is when the rapid growing stops, and from there the LLC is almost as big as the full graph, and the increase from there is very little since we are just getting \"in\" the last few isolated nodes little by little. At around 5 and 7 is when the LLC seems to have taken over"
